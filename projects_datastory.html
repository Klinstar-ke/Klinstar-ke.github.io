    <p>
      The overview dashboard summarizes key KPIs: total businesses, average size, 
      urban vs rural distribution, and average age of owners. 
      This provides a quick understanding of the general landscape before drilling deeper 
      into demographics or economic activities.

    <h2>Page 2: Business Demographics</h2>
    <p>
      This dashboard breaks down businesses by age, education, gender, and county.  
      Several key patterns emerge:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Economic Activity & Age:</strong> Most businesses are concentrated in 
          <em>Wholesale and Retail Trade</em>, dominated by owners aged 36 and above, 
          while younger groups (18â€“25) are underrepresented across most sectors.</li>
      <li><strong>Geographic Spread:</strong> Business activity is highly concentrated 
          in counties such as Nairobi, Mombasa, and Kiambu, with fewer businesses in 
          sparsely populated regions like Turkana and Marsabit.</li>
      <li><strong>Education Levels:</strong> A majority of business owners have only 
          <em>primary or secondary education</em>. College-educated and university-educated 
          business owners are fewer, suggesting businesses are driven more by opportunity 
          and necessity than formal training.</li>
      <li><strong>Gender Distribution:</strong> Female business ownership is strong, 
          with women running slightly more businesses than men. This highlights the 
          vital role of women in entrepreneurship.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Cleaning & Preparation</h2>
    <p>
      The raw data was cleaned and transformed in Python before being visualized in Power BI.  
      The cleaning steps involved handling missing values, standardizing categories, 
      and restructuring demographic variables.  
      You can view the complete Python cleaning script here:
