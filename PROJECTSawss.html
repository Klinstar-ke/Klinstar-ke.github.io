    <h2>Page 1: Overview of MSEs</h2>
    <p>
      This page highlights the big picture of Kenya’s Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs). 
      The dashboard explores the distribution of enterprises across urban and rural areas, 
      average business size, and sectoral breakdown.
    </p>

    <div class="kpi"><strong>Total Businesses:</strong> 2,000 registered enterprises</div>

    <div class="kpi"><strong>% Urban vs % Rural:</strong> Urban 49% | Rural 51%</div>
    <div class="kpi"><strong>Top Economic Activities:</strong> Agriculture, Trade, and Services</div>

    <h2>Page 2: Business Demographics</h2>
    <p>
      This dashboard breaks down businesses by age, education, gender, and county.  
      Several key patterns emerge:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Economic Activity & Age:</strong> Most businesses are concentrated in 
          <em>Wholesale and Retail Trade</em>, dominated by owners aged 36 and above, 
          while younger groups (18–25) are underrepresented across most sectors.</li>
      <li><strong>Geographic Spread:</strong> Business activity is highly concentrated 
          in counties such as Nairobi, Mombasa, and Kiambu, with fewer businesses in 
          sparsely populated regions like Turkana and Marsabit.</li>
      <li><strong>Education Levels:</strong> A majority of business owners have only 
          <em>primary or secondary education</em>. College-educated and university-educated 
          business owners are fewer, suggesting businesses are driven more by opportunity 
          and necessity than formal training.</li>
      <li><strong>Gender Distribution:</strong> Female business ownership is strong, 
          with women running slightly more businesses than men. This highlights the 
          vital role of women in entrepreneurship.</li>

    <h2>Page 1: Business Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The overview dashboard summarizes key KPIs: total businesses, average size, 
      urban vs rural distribution, and average age of owners. 
      This provides a quick understanding of the general landscape before drilling deeper 
      into demographics or economic activities.

    <h2>Conclusion & Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
      The first two pages reveal that MSEs are evenly spread between rural and urban settings, 
      with a young and educated workforce driving entrepreneurship. 
      These insights can inform government policy and targeted training programs. 
      Future sections will expand on <b>financial access, business challenges, and growth projections</b>.
