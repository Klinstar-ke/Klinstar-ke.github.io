    <h2>Page 1: Overview of MSEs</h2>
    <p>
      This page highlights the big picture of Kenyaâ€™s Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs). 
      The dashboard explores the distribution of enterprises across urban and rural areas, 
      average business size, and sectoral breakdown.
    </p>

    <div class="kpi"><strong>Total Businesses:</strong> 2,000 registered enterprises</div>
    <div class="kpi"><strong>Average Size of Business:</strong> 8 employees</div>
    <div class="kpi"><strong>% Urban vs % Rural:</strong> Urban 49% | Rural 51%</div>
    <div class="kpi"><strong>Top Economic Activities:</strong> Agriculture, Trade, and Services</div>

    <h2>Page 2: Business Demographics</h2>
    <p>
      This dashboard breaks down businesses by age, education, gender, and county.  
      Several key patterns emerge:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Economic Activity & Age:</strong> Most businesses are concentrated in 
          <em>Wholesale and Retail Trade</em>, dominated by owners aged 36 and above, 
          while younger groups (18â€“25) are underrepresented across most sectors.</li>
      <li><strong>Geographic Spread:</strong> Business activity is highly concentrated 
          in counties such as Nairobi, Mombasa, and Kiambu, with fewer businesses in 
          sparsely populated regions like Turkana and Marsabit.</li>
      <li><strong>Education Levels:</strong> A majority of business owners have only 
          <em>primary or secondary education</em>. College-educated and university-educated 
          business owners are fewer, suggesting businesses are driven more by opportunity 
          and necessity than formal training.</li>
      <li><strong>Gender Distribution:</strong> Female business ownership is strong, 
          with women running slightly more businesses than men. This highlights the 
          vital role of women in entrepreneurship.</li>

    <h2>Data Cleaning & Preparation</h2>
    <p>
      The raw data was cleaned and transformed in Python before being visualized in Power BI.  
      The cleaning steps involved handling missing values, standardizing categories, 
      and restructuring demographic variables.  
      You can view the complete Python cleaning script here:

âœ… What youâ€™ll do next:

Upload your screenshots into the projects/ folder and replace [Insert screenshot here] with <img src="demographics.png" alt="Demographics Dashboard">.

Upload your Python cleaning script into a code/ folder inside your repo so the link works.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to also prepare the storylines for Page 3, 4, 5, etc. now (before you add the screenshots), so youâ€™ll just plug them in?

Without changing anything on the code "projects/aws-ec2.html" I would like you to include the code "projects/data-story.html" and put the together inserting the two screenshots 


ChatGPT said:
Got it âœ… â€” weâ€™ll keep your original projects/aws-ec2.html intact, then add projects/data-story.html as a new page, and embed the two screenshots (overview.png + demographics.png) directly.

Hereâ€™s the final combined version of projects/data-story.html (with your screenshots inserted):

      The overview dashboard summarizes key KPIs: total businesses, average size, 
      urban vs rural distribution, and average age of owners. 
      This provides a quick understanding of the general landscape before drilling deeper 
      into demographics or economic activities.

  <!-- Conclusion -->
  <section>
    <h2>Conclusion & Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
      The first two pages reveal that MSEs are evenly spread between rural and urban settings, 
      with a young and educated workforce driving entrepreneurship. 
      These insights can inform government policy and targeted training programs. 
      Future sections will expand on <b>financial access, business challenges, and growth projections</b>.
