    <h2>Page 1: Scope of the analysis</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
	<li><strong>Introduction</strong></li>
	<p>
This analysis represents the total number of Kenyan students registered in Algerian universities during the academic year 2019/2020, including both continuing and newly admitted students in 2020. The dataset contains demographic and academic information about the students such as gender, wilaya (university region), course pursued, duration of study and student status during the study period.
 	</p>
    <p>
	 The research focuses on examining the distribution and demographic characteristics of Kenyan students in Algeria to understand their academic engagement across various courses and geographical locations. The dashboard titled Student Distribution and Demographics provides an overview of the student population structure and forms the foundation for further analysis on academic performance, completion rates, and course challenges.
	</p>
		  
<strong>Objectives of the Study</strong>
	<p>
The main objectives driving this research include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>To identify the ideal undergraduate courses for Kenyan students in Algeria — those in which students are most concentrated or have higher completion rates.</li>
 		<li>To determine the challenging courses during their academic progression, particularly by identifying areas with lower representation or higher discontinuation tendencies.</li>
		<li>To examine discontinuation rates among students, including those who may have extended their duration of study or failed to complete within the expected period.</li>
	
<p>
This study, conducted in 2025, covers data on students enrolled in 2020, focusing on those whose academic status and course duration were known by the time of analysis.
</p>


</strong>Scope and Limitations of the Study</strong>
		
	<p>
The research provides a descriptive analysis of the available student data and does not explore deeper causal factors affecting student performance or retention. Key limitations include:

	<li>The <strong>reasons behind student dropouts or discontinuations</strong> were not captured.</li>
	<li>External factors such as <strong>language proficiency in French</strong> —a possible major influence on student performance—were not evaluated.
	<li></strong>Incomplete or missing data</strong> limited the comprehensiveness of the analysis.</li>
	<li>The analysis relied solely on the available administrative data without qualitative insights from the students.</li>

Despite these limitations, the study offers a valuable foundation for understanding the demographic and academic landscape of Kenyan students in Algeria.

<li></strong>Student Distribution and Demographics </strong></li>
    <img src="student distribution and demographics1.png" alt="student distribution database" width="90%">
    <p class="caption">Figure 1: Overview dashboard of the student distribution and demographics.</p>

<li></strong>Total Student Enrollment</strong></li>

The dashboard indicates a total of 134 Kenyan students registered in Algerian universities for the academic year 2019/2020. This represents the overall population considered for the analysis, combining both continuing and newly admitted students.

<li></strong>Distribution by Course</strong></li>

The bar chart on course distribution shows that Science Technique is the most popular field among Kenyan students, followed by Economics, Medicine, and SNV (Natural and Life Sciences).
Other courses such as Computer Science, Architecture, and Dr. Pharmacie have moderate representation, while Telecommunication Engineering, Aeronautics, Dental Surgery, and Geology have the least number of students.
This trend suggests that technical and applied sciences remain the preferred fields, likely due to their professional demand and scholarship alignment.

<li></strong>Distribution by Wilaya (Region)</strong></li>

The map visualization displays the geographical distribution of Kenyan students across various Wilayas (university regions) in Algeria. Key regions include Algiers, Annaba, Bejaia, Blida, Oran, and Constantine, which host most of the universities admitting international students.
The concentration in Algiers and coastal cities indicates a preference for universities in urban and accessible regions, possibly due to better infrastructure and English-speaking support services.

<li></strong>Gender Distribution</strong></li>

The pie chart reveals a gender imbalance, with males representing 58.21% (78 students) and females at 41.79% (56 students).
This shows that while female representation is substantial, male students still dominate, especially in technical fields like Science Technique and Engineering. The balanced ratio, however, indicates growing gender inclusivity in overseas education programs.

<li><strong>Course Analysis Dashboard</strong></li>
<p>
The Course Analysis Dashboard provides a detailed overview of the performance and academic progression of Kenyan students studying in Algeria across different courses. The dashboard covers aspects such as discontinuation rates, average duration of study, success rates, and course completion durations. This helps identify which courses students excel in, where challenges are most evident, and the general academic outcomes for the period studied.
</p>

<li><strong>Discontinuation Rate, Average Duration Completed, and Total Students by Course</strong></li>

General insights.



    <ul>
	<li> Courses such as Medicine and SNV (Natural and Life Sciences) had the highest number of students (14 each), showing these are popular choices.</li>
	<li> Dr. Pharmacie and Hydraulics follow with moderate enrollment levels.</li>
	<li> Courses like Geology, Petroleum Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, and Nursing have relatively fewer students, suggesting either specialized or limited admission slots.</li>
	<li> The average duration completed for most courses ranges between 4 and 6 years, aligning with typical undergraduate timelines in Algeria.</li>
	<li> some courses exhibit higher discontinuation rates, notably Biomedical Engineering, Geology, and Dr. Pharmacie, indicating potential academic or adaptation challenges in these fields.</li>
	</ul>

<p>
High discontinuation rates in technical or health-related programs may suggest academic difficulty, inadequate preparation, or adjustment issues—possibly linked to language barriers or curriculum complexity.
</p>


<li><strong>Success Rate by Course</li></strong>

This visualization indicates the overall success rate of students across all courses, which stands at a notable 100%.

While this number could be a reflection of the students who completed their courses successfully, it may also exclude those who dropped out or whose statuses were not reported.
	  
<p>Therefore, it shows that students who persisted to the end of their studies generally succeeded in obtaining their qualifications.</p>

<strong>Insight:</strong>
Kenyan students who complete their full academic duration in Algeria demonstrate high resilience and success potential, indicating effective adaptation and academic achievement once initial barriers are overcome.


	  
<li><strong> Total Students by Course and Duration</li></strong>

This chart shows how the duration of study varies by course, reflecting the length and completion rate trends:

Economics, SNV, Telecommunication Engineering, Aeronautics, and Geology all show 100% completion rates, indicating strong performance and timely graduation.
Architecture and Dr. Pharmacie show longer durations (up to 7–8 years), implying extended study periods possibly due to academic workload or language adaptation.
Science Technique and Medicine** have mixed completion durations, with 2–6 year spans, suggesting varying progress speeds among students.
Hydraulics and Dental Surgery display balanced durations, though a few students may have taken longer to complete.

<strong>Insight:</strong>
Courses with longer durations (especially Architecture and Pharmacy) could indicate either program structure differences or instances of academic repetition and deferrals. In contrast, programs like Economics and SNV appear to have smoother progression and shorter completion times.


<li><strong>4. Discontinuation Rate and Success Rate by Course</li></strong>

This comparative chart highlights the relationship between discontinuation rates and success rates across all courses:

Courses such as Economics, Aeronautics, Biomedical Engineering, French, and Geology report 100% success rates and minimal to zero discontinuations.
Science Technique (90%), Architecture (86%), and Computer Science (70%) record slight discontinuations, implying moderate challenges.
Dental Surgery (50%) and Dr. Pharmacie (60%) exhibit lower success rates, suggesting higher dropout or failure tendencies.

<strong>Insight:</strong>
<p>
	Success rates are generally high across most disciplines, but health and engineering programs remain the most challenging. These findings emphasize the need for targeted academic support, particularly in specialized science courses where discontinuation is more pronounced.

</p>
	  
<p>
<strong>5. General Observations</strong>
<ul>
	<li>STEM fields dominate enrollment, reflecting Kenya’s focus on technical and scientific scholarship opportunities in Algeria.</li>
	<li>Medicine, Pharmacy, and Architecture have extended durations and moderate discontinuation rates, highlighting the demanding nature of these programs.</li>
	<li>Economics and SNV emerge as most stable and successful courses, combining timely completion with strong academic outcomes.</li>
	<li>Language-based and social science programs (e.g., French, Economics) display high completion and success rates, possibly due to lighter technical demands or better linguistic adaptation.</li>
	
</ul>
</p>


	  
 
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>
	  <p>
		  The Course Analysis Dashboard provides a deeper understanding of how Kenyan students perform across various Algerian university programs. Overall, the findings reveal a high academic success rate, particularly among students who manage to complete their courses.

<li><strong>Wilaya (Regional) Analysis Dashboard Interpretation</li></strong>

The Regional Analysis Dashboard explores how Kenyan students studying in Algeria perform across various Wilayas (university regions). It integrates information about average study durations, success rates by region and gender, course-based performance, and discontinuation patterns. The purpose is to identify whether regional or institutional contexts influence student outcomes.


<li><strong>Average Duration, Success Rate by Region and Gender, and Course Overview (Top-Left Panel)</li></strong>

This table summarizes students’ average duration of study, success rates by region, success rates by gender, and associated courses across multiple Wilayas.

<strong>Key Observations:</strong>
<ul>	  
	<li>The <em>average study duration</em> across all regions is approximately 4.69 years, showing that most students complete within the standard undergraduate time frame (4–5 years).</li>
	<li>The <em>overall average success rate</em> is 86.57%, which is considerably high, reflecting good academic performance among Kenyan students in Algeria.</li>
	<li>Regions such as Algiers, Annaba, Batna, Constantine, Guelma, and Boumerdes record a 100% success rate, indicating strong academic consistency and favorable institutional environments.</li>
	<li>A few Wilayas—Bejaia (92.31%) and Blida (83.33%)—show slightly lower success rates, possibly due to more demanding courses or institutional/language challenges.</li>
	<li>Gender-based success rates are nearly uniform, confirming no significant gender disparity in academic achievement.</li>
</ul>
	  
<strong>Insight:</strong>
Kenyan students in Algeria generally perform well across all regions. Variations in success rates may be influenced by course concentration or specific university conditions rather than regional factors.





<li><strong>Total Students and Discontinuation Rate by Course (Top-Right Panel)</strong></li>
<p>
This chart compares total student enrollment and discontinuation rates across courses.
</p>
	  
<strong>Key Insights:</strong>
<ul>
	<li> Most courses—especially Biomedical Engineering, Geology, French, Petroleum Engineering, and SNV—show nearly 100% retention, implying strong commitment and high completion rates.</li>
	<li> Courses such as Architecture, Dr. Pharmacie, and Computer Science show moderate discontinuation rates, suggesting academic or adaptation challenges.</li>
	<li> Science Technique and Economics have minimal dropout cases, reflecting stable academic engagement.</li>
</ul>
The discontinuation rate varies by discipline rather than region. Technical and professional programs such as **Architecture** and **Pharmacy** show higher dropout tendencies, consistent with earlier course-level analysis.





<li><strong>3. Total Students and Success Index by Wilaya (Bottom-Left Panel)</li></strong>

<p>This visualization combines the number of students and the success index across all Wilayas.</p>

<ul>
	<li> Most regions, including Oran, Constantine, Blida, Bejaia, Boumerdes, and Algiers, maintain a success index close to 100%, confirming high pass rates and steady completion.</li>
	<li> Regions with smaller student populations, such as Guelma, Setif, and Batna, also report excellent outcomes, suggesting that lower student concentration does not negatively affect performance.</li>
	<li> There is no region showing significantly low performance, reinforcing the idea that Kenyan students adapt well across Algerian university settings.</li>
</ul>

Student success is evenly distributed across regions, with minimal disparities. This suggests effective academic integration and support structures for international students across different universities.



<li><strong>4. Total Students and Success Rate by Gender (Bottom-Right Panel)</li></strong>
<p>
	This section compares the total number of male and female students with their corresponding success rates.
</p>

<strong>Findings:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The gender distribution is almost balanced, with males slightly more represented (around 58%) compared to females (42%).</li>
	<li>The success rates between male and female students are nearly identical, with both achieving high performance levels.</li>
	<li>This indicates gender parity in academic achievement, showing that both male and female Kenyan students adapt effectively to Algerian education systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no evidence of gender bias in academic outcomes. Equal success rates suggest that support and performance are consistent across genders, which is an encouraging indicator for inclusive academic environments.

</p>

<p>The Regional (Wilaya) Analysis Dashboard demonstrates that Kenyan students in Algeria achieve consistently high academic success regardless of region, gender, or institutional setting. While some minor disparities exist—especially in more technical or professional programs—overall performance remains strong.

The data suggests that regional factors have minimal impact on academic outcomes; instead, course type and academic rigor play more significant roles. These insights can inform educational partnerships and support programs between Kenya and Algeria to ensure continued student success, especially in challenging disciplines.
